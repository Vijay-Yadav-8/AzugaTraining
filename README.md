## Roadmap

- The development of project is completed under features branch i.e, [features](https://github.com/Vijay-Yadav-8/AzugaTraining/tree/features)

- The development of JAR file is completed under development branch i.e, [develop](https://github.com/Vijay-Yadav-8/AzugaTraining/tree/develop)

- The testing of the program's is completed under testing branch i.e,[testing](https://github.com/Vijay-Yadav-8/AzugaTraining/tree/testing)

## Features

The Project Azuga Training has codes for different applications like,
- [Linux-commands](https://github.com/Vijay-Yadav-8/AzugaTraining/tree/features/week1#:~:text=15%20days%20ago)
The project contains programs that mimics some of the basic Linux-Commands like cat, wc, head, tail, sort, ls etc

- [Api-Calls](https://github.com/Vijay-Yadav-8/AzugaTraining/tree/features/week2)
It is included with programs for major Api's GET methods to get the data from the Api's and use them to create the .csv and .json files. 

- [File-Formatting](https://github.com/Vijay-Yadav-8/AzugaTraining/tree/features/week3)
The data from the Api's Call method stored in .csv and .json file are formatted to the .xml, .pdf, .html formats.

- [Charts Creation](https://github.com/Vijay-Yadav-8/AzugaTraining/tree/features/week3)
The Api's data in the files are used to create the charts, i.e to visualize the properties of the Api. Bar chart, Pie Chart and Line Chart are created.

- [OOPs Concepts](https://github.com/Vijay-Yadav-8/AzugaTraining/tree/features/oop)
OOps concepts like interface, methods, objects, classes, constructors, abstraction etc were also used in the java codes.

- [Zip And UnZip](https://github.com/Vijay-Yadav-8/AzugaTraining/tree/features/week4)
The reports created from the Api calls and Formatters were zipped, unzipped and sent through the mail programatically using java language.

## Run Locally
